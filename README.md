I've developed this over the years, and will evolve over the years to come.  Where will it be in 10 years?  In 20?

This document is aspirational. I hold myself to it as best I can, but part of it is that failure is expected and, in fact, encouraged. If you're not failing - you're not trying hard enough. And as I learn, this document will evolve.  Where will it be in 10 years?

Part of holding myself accountable to this was that I share my yearly review with anyone that works for me. I mean, it's a little redacted to pull anything like pay out of it, but other than that - I feel that the people who work for me ABSOLUTELY have the right to know what is in store for me.  What I have to work on.  What's going well and what's not.  If you're a manager - try it!

The other big part is disseminating this document and encouraging people to hold me to it. 

Enjoy!

(Oh, and if you see me acting counter to these ideals, no matter who you are - say something. :) )
