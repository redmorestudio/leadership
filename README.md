# Leadership Philosophy

[Click this link to get the actual leadership philosophy](https://github.com/redmorestudio/leadership/blob/main/Seth's%20Leadership%20Philosophy%20v4.0.pdf).  

I've developed this over the years, and will evolve over the years to come.  

This document is aspirational. I hold myself to it as best I can, but failure is encouraged. If I'm not failing sometimes, then I'm not trying hard enough. And as I learn, this document will evolve. Where will it be in 10 years?  In 20?

This isn't just a bunch of bullets - I make sure that it is well distributed, commented on, and that my peers, bosses, and memebers of my team understand what I'm trying to do. I encourage an open, honest, kind, and constant feedback loop. 

I am a firm believer that leadership isn't just for managers and execs.  It's for everyone.  You don't have to be looking at a 3-year planning horizon to want (or need) to lead.  Leadership can be as simple as gracefully challenging assumptions, or introducing new ways to do things. I mean it very seriously when I say that everyone has some opportunity to lead in their own lives.

Clearly, this document is going to be optimized for work stuff, but the themes in it resonate everywhere.

Enjoy!

(Oh, and if you see me acting counter to these ideals, no matter who you are - say something. :) )
