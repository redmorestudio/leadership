# Leadership Philosophy

[Click this link to get the actual leadership philosophy](https://github.com/redmorestudio/leadership/blob/main/Seth's%20Leadership%20Philosophy%20v1.2.pdf).  

I've developed this over the years, and instantiated the actual idea of having an explicit philosophy (and early versions of the philosophy itself) with the help and guidance of Cliff Gilmore.  Cliff is quite the coach - read more about him [here](https://medium.com/@NorthofCenter/if-you-are-thinking-about-hiring-a-north-of-center-coach-8ea52e2fe452).

This document is aspirational. I hold myself to it as best I can, but part of it is that failure is expected and, in fact, encouraged. If you're not failing - you're not trying hard enough.

Part of holding myself accountable to this was that I share my yearly review with anyone that works for me. I mean, it's a little redacted to pull anything like pay out of it, but other than that - I feel that the people who work for me ABSOLUTELY have the right to know what is in store for me.  What I have to work on.  What's going well and what's not.  If you're a manager - try it!

The other big part is disseminating this document and encouraging people to hold me to it. 

It's clear to me that it needs a bit of editing, crisping up. (And always will.)  But even as it stands, I'm quite happy with it, and am happy to stand behind it.  

Enjoy!

(Oh, and if you see me acting counter to these ideals, no matter who you are - say something. :) )
